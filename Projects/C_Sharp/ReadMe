At the Tech Academy, we did dozens of projects in C#. The complexity of the projects ranged from the very basic to the overly complex. 

The overly complex projects required significant instructor assistance. And, for that reason they are not posted here. The two 

programs posted here, Epic Spies and Pizza Menu, were both completed independently.

I completed additional projects outside of the curriculm to further my understanding of C_Sharp. Those, I posted here. I found these projects 

posted on line and worked them on my own.

**MediaMusicPlayer** is a simple MP3 player. There were several different ways to do this. Ultimately, I found a media player in the VS 

toolbox and then separately coded the controls. 

**MatchingPairGame** is a matching game. It involves matching like symbols until all the pairs of symbols in the grid have been 

simultaneously selected. The symbols were randomly generated for each new game. There were two small challenges: the first was 

to actually set up the grid. After selecting "forms" in VS, that became straightforward. The second challenge was generating the random 

selection for each new game. That was done with the random method. 

Whatever you do, whatever you are thinking...do not play the **Maze**. You will not get any more work done for rest of the weekend. You will 

not feed your dog. The Maze project tested my creativity. It looks like a simple game, and it is, after you get over the first 

creative hurdle. The interior walls are simply labels with a mouseevent set to "enter". After that, a sound player is used to indicate 

the cursor has been moved back to start.

**Screensaver** is screenshots from a fun, happy YouTube video set to the Pharel Williams song, *Happy*. The video can be found here 

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGrHwBlf-7M). This project was combined a for loop, timer and screensaver to shot the images on the 

screen. There was a random method to govern the placement. One drawback is that the random method does not change afte interval period 

so the images end up back int the same spot and the same images are choosen.

**Currency Converter** was a clever little project which turned out to be pretty simple. Before I started, I looked up API's for a 

Google currency converter. Stack OverFlow had several querries. There were also multiple YouTube videos to complete this project. Since 

I have not had experience using an API, I was excited to work on this project to learn something new.  I created the form, and then 

searched the VS toolbox, I found a web browser window and placed that in my form. At that point, it was easy enough to enter the URL 

into web brower properties and the project captured the Google currency converter. It turns out, I did not need to use a Google API.

**Custom Web Browser** built on the prior application's use of the web brower tool. Here, the coding issue was to have the web browser 

tool read the combo box. This was accomplished using a navigation method based in the web broswer as an arugment. 

** The Calculator ** There are numerous little C# projects on line to create a caluclator. When I thought about laying on the project, I 

was not sure how to capture the value of the buttons without using something  like a conditional statement. C# has a build in Button method. 

After I learned about that, the project was straightforward to complete using a switch statement to invoke the chosen operation.

**Digital Clock** was very straightforward. It was a simple matter to add labels and assign those labels a value based on DateTime.Now 

method.

**Digital Clock II** was similar to ** Digital Clock** but the second update at the second interval. This was done by using the timer tool

creating a method that update once a second.
 
 **LogIn** connects to an SQL database. The "data" button gives sample data to input into the User Name and Password. 
 
 **Custom Map** querries a Google Map. The app creates an instance of Stringbuilder and navigates to the URL field in the web browser tool. 
 
 **Image Database** This was another project using SQL to create a database in Virtual Studio.
