In an effort to improve my C# skills, I completed drill sets found at [www.W3Resources.com](https://www.w3resource.com/index.php).

The sets ranged from simple to complicated. 

This was the first set that I completed. I could see my skills improving and knowledge increasing as I prepared to host these on GitHub. 
My early errors were pretty glaring. My time at repairing my coding decreased signficiantly.
