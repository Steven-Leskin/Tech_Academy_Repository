In an effort to improve my C# skills, I completed drill sets found at www.W3Resources.com. 

The sets ranged from simple to complicated. 

This was the first set that I completed. I could see my skills improving and knowledge increasing as I prepared to host these on GitHub. 

My early errors were pretty glaring, and my time at fixing my errors increased signficiantly.
